# LATTDES-Hybrid-Secure-Communication-Combining-Lattice-Based-Cryptography-with-DES-Encryption
Enhanced secure communication by combining lattice-based cryptography (Newhope algorithm) with the Data 
Encryption Standard (DES) to achieve robust, quantum-resistant encryption.
Merged the efficiency and simplicity of DES with the strong security guarantees of lattice-based cryptography, ensuring 
both high-speed data processing and enhanced security.
Demonstrated a 98% success rate in secure data transmission tests and achieved encryption speeds of up to 50 MB/s 
with minimal latency, highlighting the effectiveness and practicality of the hybrid cryptographic solution.
Technologies used: Newhope, DES, C++, cryptographic libraries, network protocols, benchmarking tools
